## Introduction
Hello, My name is Josh Gold, and I'm a security professional based out of Portland, Oregon.   I discuss five of the 2025 Holiday Hack Challenge objectives below.  For each I will include a summary of the challenge, my thought process and a solution overview including screen captures.  <br>

For most of the challenges I went from a starting point of ignorance, progressed to a state of exploration (sometimes guess and check), and sooner or later wound up at an AHA moment.  Often AHA was more later than sooner.  For some of the challenges I found it valuable to call it quits for the day. and return a day later, giving time for thoughts and ideas to evolve. <br>

I hope you enjoyed the event as much as I did.
